                <p>Howdy, my name is Felipe Koji called Felitrix, and I'm an enthusiast about open source programming
                    and
                    projects
                    <br>
                    Currently, I am self-taught, because I find it much easier to learn, making an effort to debug a
                    code, to code what you want and not step by step with a simple code that has nothing to do with my
                    main objective, searching the internet how to solve such a problem since we have it, why not use it?
                    <br>
                    I have some goals in mind which is to be GNU/Linux user of my primary machine, finish some courses
                    even though I'm self-taught I see the need to take some courses to enter the professional
                    environment.
                    One of my precepts is as long as I am active, I will make the internet free for everyone; an open
                    source promotes the development of the technology in its entirety; a healthy Internet, that's why I
                    support Mozilla.<span class="cursor">â–ˆ</span>
