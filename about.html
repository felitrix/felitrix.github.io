            <code>Felitrix@meow:~$ whoami</code>
            <p>Howdy, my name is Felipe Koji called Felitrix, and and I'm an open source programming and projects
                enthusiast.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am self-taught, because I find it much easier to learn, making an effort to debug a
                code, to code what you want and not step by step with a simple code that has nothing to do with my
                main objective, searching the internet how to solve such a problem since we have it, why not use it?
            </p>
            <p>I have some goals in mind which is to be GNU/Linux user of my primary machine, finish some courses
                even though I'm self-taught I see the need to take some courses to enter the professional
                environment.</p>
            <p>One of my precepts is as long as I am active, I will make the internet free for everyone; an open
                source promotes the development of the technology in its entirety; a healthy Internet, that's why I
                support Mozilla.</p>
